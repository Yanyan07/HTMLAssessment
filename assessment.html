    <h2>TEXT</h2>
    <p><strong>The</strong> Super Bowl is the annual championship game of the National Football League (NFL). It has served as the final game of every NFL season since 1966, replacing the NFL Championship Game. Since 2004, the game has been played on the first Sunday in February. </p>
    <pre>        <em><strong>Winning</strong> teams are awarded with the Vince Lombardi Trophy, named after the eponymous coach who
        won the first two Super Bowl games. Due to the NFL restricting use of its "Super Bowl" trademark,
        it is frequently referred to as the "big game". </em></pre>
    <p><strong>The</strong> Super Bowl is among the world's most-watched single sporting events and frequently commands the largest audience among all American broadcasts during the year. It is second only to the UEFA Champions League final as the most watched annual sporting event worldwide and the seven most-watched broadcasts in American television history are Super Bowls. </p>
